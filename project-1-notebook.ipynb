    "# Project 1: Algorithmic trading (100 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic trading is the use of computer programs to automate stock trading decisions, based on available data such as share price or trading volume over different periods of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement different trading strategies in Python, and put them to the test by evaluating their performance on simulated stock market data. This is a similar study as that done e.g. in [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068344).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸš© There is quite a lot of text to explain context -- to make sure you don't miss any tasks, they are marked with a little red flag (like in the tutorial sheets).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **write a Python [package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)** called `trading`. A package is basically a folder containing `.py` files (*modules*) with some function definitions inside -- you should see that this folder is already created in your repo. The package contain five [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules): `data.py`, `process.py`, `indicators.py`, `strategy.py`, and `performance.py`, as well as an initialisation script `__init__.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write functions inside each module to perform different tasks. Then, you will use your custom modules in this Jupyter notebook to run your simulations. Just like for any other package, you will need to import it in the notebook first. For example, to use the function `create_portfolio()` in the `process.py` module, you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import trading.process as proc\n",
    "portfolio = proc.create_portfolio(...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script `__init__.py` is just here to indicate that `trading` is a Python package, and not just a simple folder. It can remain empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if, for example, your functions in your module `strategy.py` need any other modules to work (e.g. Numpy, pyplot, or one of your other custom modules...), you'll need to import them at the start of `strategy.py`. You'll also need to import them again if the code you use here (in the notebook) requires it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task will give more detailed instructions of what should go in each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** if you change anything in one of your modules, even if you run the `import trading....` command again in the notebook, this **will not update** with the new version of your module. Instead, **restart the kernel** and import the module again to use your latest changes (Kernel > Restart in the toolbar).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working on your project with git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "- To **submit** your project, all you need to do is have your final version (ready for submission) **pushed to your GitHub repo**. At the deadline, we will clone all repos with `pp-project-1` in the name to collect your submissions.\n",
    "- For that reason, **do not rename your repo** on GitHub! If you've renamed your repo and we cannot clone it at the deadline, you will be liable for **late penalties**.\n",
    "- While working on the project, **commit your changes often** -- every time you make progress on a subtask. If you tend to forget to do this regularly, you could e.g. set a timer on your phone to remind you to commit every hour or so.\n",
    "- You don't necessarily need to push your changes to GitHub every time you commit, although we'd strongly recommend that you **push them regularly**. This ensures that 1) you won't have any last-minute technical issues when it comes to submitting, and 2) you have an online backup of your work, just in case e.g. your computer breaks down.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **individual** assignment -- just like for the Coderunner quizzes, the work your submit must be your own, to reflect and assess your own understanding and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collaboration vs. collusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration is fine, but collusion is not. Concretely, this means that discussing the assignment **in broad terms** with others students is fine (and encouraged), as well as giving each other hints or general advice on how to approach a problem. You can use Piazza for this, for example -- if you are stuck, then please ask for help! However, you are **not permitted** to share your working (even partially) with other students -- that includes your code, any detailed description or explanation of code, and any results or analysis you perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Alice and Bob are discussing the assignment on a Zoom call. Bob's code is not working for one of the questions, and he can't figure out why. He asks Alice how she's tackled the problem, and she explains her approach in broad terms. This gives Bob an idea, and he tries it later. *This is all fine.*\n",
    "- Bob's idea doesn't work out, and he calls Alice again. He shares his screen with her to show his code. *This is getting dangerous* -- here's why:\n",
    "    - Alice helps him with understanding the error, and gives him some pointers and ideas to try, without explaining the problem or the solution in much detail. *That would still be fine.*\n",
    "    - Alice is stuck on the next question, though, and spots a couple of lines of Bob's code at the bottom of the screen. She uses some of that code for the next question in her submission. This is not OK: *both Bob and Alice have now committed misconduct* -- Alice by using Bob's code, and Bob by sharing his screen.\n",
    "- Bob is still stuck. He posts his code for that question on Piazza. Some students help and also give him some  general advice. Charlie sees the post on Piazza, and didn't know how to start that question. Charlie uses some of Bob's code, with some corrections to fix the problems, and submits it for the assignment. *This is also misconduct* by both Bob and Charlie.\n",
    "- Bob is still stuck (poor Bob!). It's getting very close to the deadline now, so he asks his friend Dara to *pleaaaase* show their solution, he promises not to copy it. Bob and Dara are really good friends, so Dara finds it difficult to refuse and sends their code. Bob rewrites Dara's code by changing some variable names, rearranging a bit, and paraphrasing the code comments so that they are \"in his own words\". *This is misconduct* by both Bob and Dara.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use and trust your own judgement. It's important to understand that even with the best intentions, you expose yourself to academic misconduct as soon as you show your code to another student.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Providing references\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code in your submission must be **authored by you**. That being said, you may use any code from the course material (e.g. workshop tasks, tutorial sheets, videos), without citing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also use **small pieces of code** (a few lines max at a time) that you found elsewhere -- e.g. examples from the documentation, a textbook, forums, blogs, etc... You may use this code *verbatim* (i.e. almost exactly as you found it), or adapt it to write your own solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming assignment is just like any other academic assignment -- and therefore, **you must provide a citation for any such code**, whether you use it *verbatim* or adapt it. To do so, include a code comment at the start of your script or notebook cell, indicating:\n",
    "- the line numbers where the code was used or adapted,\n",
    "- the URL of the source (or, if it's from a book, a full reference to the book),\n",
    "- the date you accessed the source,\n",
    "- the author of the code (if the information is available).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this template -- delete one of the URL or book reference lines as appropriate:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lines X-Y: Author Name\n",
    "# URL: http://...\n",
    "# Book Title, year published, page number.\n",
    "# Accessed on 31 Nov 2020.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also provide **detailed code comments** for any such code, in your own words, to demonstrate that you fully understand how it works -- you will lose marks if you use external code without explaining it, even if it's cited correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to exercise caution if you use any code from external sources -- there are a lot of blogs and forums out there with very bad code! I'd recommend that you review the Week 4 video on searching the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that, we trust that you'll be able to use your best judgement, and to cite your sources appropriately -- if anything is not clear, please do ask. Note that **all submissions** will be automatically checked (and manually reviewed) for plagiarism and collusion, and [the University's academic misconduct policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/staff/discipline/academic-misconduct) applies.\n",

    "## Task 1: Code review and debugging (30 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your junior colleague has started to work on the project. They started with writing the code to generate the simulated stock market data, for a number of stocks. Here is the brief for this part of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Generate simulated stock prices over a period of time, for a given number of companies, given share price at initial date, and volatility. Return data in a NumPy array, each column representing the price history for 1 company, and each row representing the share prices for all the stocks at a given date.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The time increment is **1 day**, and share prices are given as the **closing price** each day.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We assume that the [random walk hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis) holds. This means that the share price $p_t$ on a given day ($t>0$) and for a given company is normally given by\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "p_{t} = p_{t-1} + \\Delta p_t,\n",
    "$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where $\\Delta p_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$ is the share price increment each day, normally distributed with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. We take $\\sigma$ to represent the inherent **volatility** of the stock.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Whenever a share price dips to zero, we consider the company closed, and the daily share prices starting on that day until the end of the simulation should be set to `NaN`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We also model randomly occurring **important news** (e.g. political turmoil, a natural disaster, a new product announcement...), which have a positive or negative impact on share price over a number of days. This impact is modelled as a temporary **drift** $d$ in share price increments, positive or negative, with more or less magnitude depending on the volatility of the stock price.\n",
    "> - Every day, there is a 1% chance of such an event happening, and immediately starting to impact the price of a given stock.\n",
    "> - To represent that the news might impact an inherently more volatile stock more significantly than a less volatile stock, the drift $d$ is proportional to $\\sigma$.\n",
    "> - To represent that high-impact events happen more rarely, we choose $d = m \\sigma$, with $m \\sim N(0, 2^2)$ -- that is, the drift is equal to $m$ standard deviations of the usual increment. This means that the event is equally likely to be positive or negative, but that, for example, the magnitude of the drift is only about 5% likely to be greater than $4\\sigma$.\n",
    "> - When an event occurs, its impact lasts for anywhere between 3 days and 2 weeks -- i.e. the total duration is $t_{\\text{event}} \\sim U\\{3, 14\\}$.\n",
    "> - The impact of several events occurring over the same time span is cumulative.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> To summarise, the share price $p_t$ on a given day ($t>0$) and for a given company is given by\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "p_t = p_{t-1} + \\Delta p_t + \\sum_i d_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where each $d_i$ is the drift caused by an \"active\" event.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example: if the current day is $t = 15$, and\n",
    "> - at $t = 10$, a negative event occurred, causing a drift $d_1$ lasting $6$ days,\n",
    "> - at $t = 12$, another negative event occurred, causing a drift $d_2$ lasting $12$ days,\n",
    "> - at $t = 15$ (today), a positive event occurs, causing a drift $d_3$ lasting $3$ days,\n",
    ">\n",
    "> then the share price today is given by\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$ p_{15} = p_{14} + \\Delta p_{15} + d_1 + d_2 + d_3. $$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> And tomorrow, if no event occurs, the first negative event will cease to have an impact:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$ p_{16} = p_{15} + \\Delta p_{16} + d_2 + d_3. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your colleague started working on the task, but they are now on parental leave, and they won't be back at work for a few months. You are tasked with continuing the project -- but first, as is good practice in the company, you should provide a **code review** for them, which they can read and learn from upon their return.\n",
    "\n",
    "They didn't have time to properly test the code before leaving, and since you will continue working on the project, you also need to **test and debug** this code before going any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the function `generate_stock_price()` written by your colleague is in the `data.py` module, and here they call the function to generate the data. Your review should cover **all of the code** -- both the function definition and the use here."

    "### ðŸš© Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write your **code review** in the Markdown cell below, as well as a report of any **bugs** you find in the code. Remember, as always, your feedback should be helpful and constructive, and help the author not only improve this code, but learn and improve their programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, revise the code: write a version which is free of bugs, and implement your review recommendations about structure and style. Any functions should be in `data.py`, and your code which calls the functions to generate data should be in the code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can overwrite the buggy function in `data.py` with your new code -- you'll still be able to inspect the original code if you need, by looking at the first commit in the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: when debugging code which uses random numbers, it's usually a good idea to test it on more consistent data. Depending on what you need to test:\n",
    "- if you are testing features or parts of your code which don't rely on the data actually being random, then **remove the randomness!** Start with simple, predictable data, and build up the complexity.\n",
    "    - **For example** (these are just suggestions, not instructions!), the function `news()` here has 3 random variables; can you first check that it gives the expected output if you assign fixed values to all 3? If it does, then does it still work if 1 of the variables is random but the other 2 are fixed? In `generate_stock_price()`, do you get the expected output if you set `inc` to a fixed number, and remove any adjustments to do with the news?\n",
    "- if your test requires randomness, you can provide a **seed** to the generator (here, `np.random.default_rng()`) -- this ensures that running the code multiple times will always give the same numbers. [The documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#numpy.random.default_rng) says that you can give a seed (an integer of your choice) as an input argument to `np.random.default_rng()`.\n",
    "- another way to test with randomness is to run **lots of simulations** (with different seeds, this time).\n",
    "    - For instance (still an illustrative example, not an instruction), in `news()`, you could check whether `m` is computed correctly by using the same command to generate many numbers, and plot a histogram of these numbers to check that it does look like the normal distribution with standard deviation 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as always, when testing, start small and simple, and don't hesitate to `print()` and `plot()`!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Note:** If your code is still not working, but you were not able to fix all the bugs, then you should provide any **tests** you run which show that the output is still not correct, and **explain where you think the error(s) come from**, to the best of your understanding. You should be able to achieve most of the marks for the task even if you don't fix every bug, as long as you can identify that there are still errors, provide test data which highlights them, and explain your insights and your reasoning as to where could the error be.\n",

    "#### Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "*List any bugs you find in the code here. It may be convenient to refer to line numbers (View > Toggle Line Numbers if you can't see them).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first simple bug I have spotted is that you have made use of the NumPy library in the `data.py` module but have failed to import it. This is also true in the Jupyter test cell above where you have also failed to `import matpplotlib.pyplot as plt`. This is an easy solve, but please be wary that you have imported all the necessary libraries to be able to run your code. In addition, it is also good practise to provide an additional `dependencies.txt` file in the `trading` package detailing all the necessary libraries as well as the versions needed to run this package to allow users to quickly set up a conda/pyenv environment. Here is a nice guide for this https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/specifying-dependencies-python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typo on line 21: `stock_price` should be `stock_prices`. Good variable name choice though! This clearly indicates that this variable holds some object with many values. I'm a fan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* On line 28 where the `news_today` variable is provide, you do not provide the `rng.choice` generator with the correct arguments. Since we pass a list/array from which we wish the geneator to sample from, the `p` keyword argument needs to be supplied with a list of the same length where each element corresponds to the probability associated with each entry of the input list/array. Judging from the context of the code and hence assuming `1 == news_today` and `0 == no news_today`, the `p` keyword argument should be changed to `p = [1 - chance, chance]`. See documentation here for more details https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.choice.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An almost silent bug was found on line 34 where you were randomly sampling from a discrete uniform distribution to chose the duration of the news event with `rng.integers(7,7*12)`. The brief states that news events can only last between 3 and 12 days and hence this should be changed to `rng.integers(3, 15)` - the second argument is exclusive. A similar bug is also present on line 31 where the `m` is sampled from a gaussian with standard deviation 0.3 rather than 2 and on line 19 where `inc` is sampled from the standard normal rather than a normal with standard deviation equal to the `volatility`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another bug that is apparent is on line 40. The block of code within the else statement will throw an error since we reference a non-existant variable, `duration`. This is because the `duration` variable defined on line 34 only exists within the scope of the if statement. I would hence return `np.array([0])` rather than `np.zeros(duration)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `totalDrift` array used to store drift values is too small. For example, lets say on day `1000` a news event occurs that lasts a total of 10 days. Since `totalDrift` is of size 1000, the following code fails - `        total_drift[day:day+duration] = d` since index `day + duration = 1010` does not reference any part of the `totalDrift` array. We must therefore increase the size of this array to `days + max(duration)` which in our case happens to be `days + 14`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, on line 46 you write `totalDrift[day:day+duration] = d` which overwrites drift values collected from previous days. In order to be line with the equations given in the brief, this must be changed to         `totalDrift[day:day+duration] += d` to amalgamate the total drift in stock prices due to multiple news events.\n",

    "* Whilst I like that you have created a separate function, `news` for generating the news in order to increase modularity and readability, I *highly* recommend you to not define this function within the `generate_stock_price` function on line 23. You should instead define the `news` function and its body above the `generate_stock_price` function hence still allowing it to be called on line 42. It should also be noted thae the function was defined within the for loop over days. This means that the function was unneccessarily re-defined for each day which is extremely wasteful of computational resources. The cost of this move is that we now must pass the random number generator as an argument to the function which I think is worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Within the news function you define the elements of the `final` variable using a for loop over its length on line ####. A better implementation of this would be to use a Python list comprehension to set these values. This makes the code more concise and hence improves readibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code style\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write your comments and recommendations about code style here (readability, style consistency, variable naming, code comments, docstrings...).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whilst very clear, there are too many comments in the `data.py` module making the module look messy and crowded. For example, lines 10, 15, 16 and many more are self-explanatory and the code would become clearer if these comments were ommitted. The commenting style seen within the body of the `news` function is much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Slight nit-picking but your use of whitespace is inconsistent. Some examples can be seen in lines (34 and 42) as well as (50 and 51). Please stick to a single whitespace convention and stick with it. I'm personally in favour of adding white space between operations and variables name such as in lines 17, 32, and 42 but leaving no whitespace when defining keyword arguments to functions like you've done on line 28. Whitespace is an under-appreciated tool in code that can help improve the overall readibility. The only time I break my previously defined convention is if I believe I can further increase the code's clarity e.g. `foo = 3*9 + 2*5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another case of not sticking with convention is your use of both camelCase and pythonic underscores for variable names. Please stick to the pythonic underscores and refer to the PEP8 style guide for a comprehensive overview of what style is expected when writing Python code https://pep8.org/. Furthermore, these variable names could be improved, for example, `d` does not indicate that this is an array of drifts for stocks. A better variable name would be something like `drifts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your docstrings are clear and concise but are lacking in the necessary details about the function's arguments and outputs. For example, in the `news` function you should provide details that `chance` is specifically a float representing the probability that a news event happens on a given date. If this was implemented, it is unlikely you would have run into the bug on line 44 since your docstring would tell you that the output from news is an array not a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One final formatting improvement that can be made is by changing the name of the `news` function to something like `generate_news_drift` or `get_news_drift`. These names are more informative of what this function does whilst `news` is very ambiguous. I recommend you name your functions with names that are indicative of what that function performs.\n",
